							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<h2>In Summary</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/newprofile.png" alt="" /></span>Very few people know this about me, but I decided to start designing at a young age. My father started losing his ability to walk when I was nine, and ever since I started watching him struggle in a world that wasn't designed for him, I felt the need to help. With that end in mind, I originally decided to become a Biomedical Engineer.
								Unfortunately, my love for physics was not nearly as strong as my love for art, and I quickly realized I was in over my head. I was fortunate enough to find a program that supported my creative abilities, as well as fostered my interest in technology: Computational Media, a marriage between computer science and media/communications. The decision to change my focus was one that would absolutely change my life, and more than anything, my perspective of people.
							</p>
							<p>Before I meandered into the professional title of a "UX Designer," I practiced human-centered focus in product management and analysis. I've studied user behavior from a data-driven lens, understood its priority within the product ecosystem, and been graced with the opportunity to design around it. That experience has provided me the unique opportunity to attempt to bridge the gap between business priorities and being an advocate for the user.
								I've found that a mature practice carries both responsibilities with ease. It is from this point of view that I hope to carry myself through my journey within the User Experience profession, learning something new with every opportunity along the way.
